This post is about my experience on a good scrum team and a bad one and how one bad egg can effect the entire team dynamic. 

### Culture

This is a big deal. Potential team members must be a good fit for the team. Do gangs just let anybody join? I am unsure. I would think no. Make your team exclusive!
Often people think that developers are all the same. After all we are just mere code monkeys. Feel free to just throw them all together in a cage (or open floor plan) and they will produce the softwares you desperately desire. Not going to happen! Productive software development is extremely dependent on the quality of the relationships on the team. Communication is key to production and if the members of the team are unable to communicate effectively there will be problems with team efficiency. In my experience on my current team we had a very solid dynamic on our team. After introducing a new team member it all went downhill. It was absolutely clear in the first two weeks that the fit was bad. If this happens to your scrum team act fast before your team implodes. Vote Kick.

    team.slice(badEgg);

### Forcing Bad Fits

I imagine it is difficult for people outside of the agile world to understand why the process is the way it is. A big mistake managers make is forcing bad fits on teams. Ask any software engineer that has worked on a team with people they can't stand to be around. The team dynamic will be unsuccesful unless the team members can pick who is on their team. I cannot stress this enough.. give your teams the flexibility they need to pick their own members.
