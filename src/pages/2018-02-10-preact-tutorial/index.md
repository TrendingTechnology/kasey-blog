In this tutorial we are going to build a simple preact application.

### Let's Get Started

We first need to set up our environment. We are going to use `preact-cli` to generate our starter files.

```bash
npm install -g preact-cli
```

Now that we have the preact command line installed we can use one of their templates to generate a starter project. You can find a list of all the supported templates [here](https://github.com/preactjs-templates/).

```bash
preact create preactjs-templates/simple preact-tutorial
cd preact-tutorial
npm run start
```

Now you can open up a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see the application in action.

It may not look like much but we have been gifted with a beautiful and lightweight canvas!
