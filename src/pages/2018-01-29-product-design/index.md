### Good Product Bad Product

As a software engineer sometimes you are blessed with a perspective on product design that others cannot attain. Excellent products are hard to come by. While there is some subjectivety in regards to design here are some things that make a product less than ideal for me.

A Bad Product
* has too many or not enough features
* has features that provide no value
* lacks aesthetics
* lacks a definite vision

A Good Product
* has a narrow set of useful features
* has a distinct purpose
* is easy operate
* is visually appealing

### Minimalism

Less is more! A simple product but one that provides the user with a lot of value per feature will always be more effective than one that is too complex for its own good. I would recommend thinking critically everytime a feature is propositioned. Does this feature add a significant amount of value versus the amount of time and complexity it adds in the application.

### Clear, Concise, and Consistent Vision

The vision for the product must come from one unified source. The product should be easily explained in one sentence. Having too many wildly different inputs on a product's vision can muddy it up to the point of unusability.

### Simple & Easy

The product should be easy for a user to understand. They should quickly be able to discover the features and constraints and how they can leverage it to fulfill their needs. Does the user need to read the documentation for your product to use its basic features? Perhaps it is too complicated if you are solving a simple problem. Understanding your users is key for the user to understand your product.

>“Good design makes a product understandable.
It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.”
